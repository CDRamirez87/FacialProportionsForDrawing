# FaceMeasurements
Originally written in C++ May 2015 in Code::Blocks
Version 1.0

This was my first attempt at a practical program. When one draws a portrait, there are 
dimensions in the drawing that can be determined algoritmically. This program attempts
to streamline that process.

The program requires the initial facial circle to be drawn and then extrapolates the ratios
to help the user divide the facial features appropriately. Then, when the vertical coordinates
have been assessed, it asks how much the user would like to shave off of the sides of the circle
(to depict cheek curvature). It then provides the user with the appropriate X coordinates.
